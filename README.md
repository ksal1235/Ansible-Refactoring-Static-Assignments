# Ansible-Refactoring-Static-Assignments

In this project, We will continue working with ansible-config-mgt repository and make some improvements of code. Now We need to refactor Ansible code, create assignments, and learn how to use the imports functionality. Imports allow to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook - it allows us to organize tasks and reuse them when needed.

### Code Refactoring

Refactoring is a general term in computer programming. It means making changes to the source code without changing expected behaviour of the software. The main idea of refactoring is to enhance code readability, increase maintainability and extensibility, reduce complexity, add proper comments without affecting the logic.
